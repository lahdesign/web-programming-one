</div>

<h2>position</h2>

<code>position: static;
</code>

<p>This is the default.</p>

<div class="samplebox">
	<div style="position: static;">Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</div>
</div>

<code>position: fixed;
</code>

<div class="samplebox">
	<p>This example is in the upper right of the screen.</p>
	<div style="position: fixed; top: 10px; right: 10px;">(position: fixed;)<br> Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</div>
</div>

<code>position: relative;
</code>

<div class="samplebox">
	<p>A relative positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position.</p>
	<div style="position: relative; top: 10px; left: 50px;">(position: relative;)<br> Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</div>
</div>

<code>position: absolute;
</code>

<div class="samplebox">
	<p>An absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static. If no such element is found, the containing block is &lt;html&gt;.</p>
	<div style="position: absolute; top: 40px; right: 50px; z-index: -1;">(position: absolute;)<br> Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</div>
</div>

<h2>z-index</h2>

<code>z-index: -1;
</code>

<p>The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. (In this example the div with the dotted line is set to relative positioning so the coordinates for the red and blue boxes will be based on it&rsquo;s location.)</p>

<div class="samplebox" style="height: 2em;">
	<div style="position: absolute; z-index: 2; background-color: red;">Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</div>
	<div style="position: absolute; z-index: 1; left: 5px; top: 5px; background-color: blue;">Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</div>
</div>

<h2>left</h2>

<code>left: 30px;
</code>

<p>This applies to fixed, relative, and absolute positioning</p>

<div class="samplebox" style="height: 2em;">
	<div style="position: relative; left: 30px; background-color: red;">Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</div>
</div>

<h2>right</h2>

<code>right: 30px;
</code>

<p>This applies to fixed, relative, and absolute positioning</p>

<div class="samplebox" style="height: 2em;">
	<div style="position: relative; right: 30px; background-color: red;">Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</div>
</div>

<h2>top</h2>

<code>top: 10px;
</code>

<p>This applies to fixed, relative, and absolute positioning</p>

<div class="samplebox" style="height: 4em;">
	<div style="position: absolute; top: 10px; background-color: red;">Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</div>
</div>

<h2>bottom</h2>

<code>bottom: 10px;
</code>

<p>This applies to fixed, relative, and absolute positioning</p>

<div class="samplebox" style="height: 4em;">
	<div style="position: absolute; bottom: 10px; background-color: red;">Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</div>
